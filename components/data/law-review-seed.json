      "content": "This Article advances a simple, administrable reform to reconcile constitutional adjudication with democratic accountability. Under a Rule of Maintenance, the Supreme Court will continue to adjudicate cases under existing precedent but may not change the level of protection for constitutional rights without democratic authorization. When a properly presented case would alter the rights baseline—either to restrict or to expand—two‑thirds of the Court must certify the framed constitutional question to Congress. The Court issues a maintenance judgment applying current law to the parties and stays any alteration pending a fast‑track, recorded legislative decision. To prevent majoritarian abuse, the design includes an Eternity Schedule of non‑derogable guarantees, sunsets for restrictions, and recertification rules.",

      "title": "I. From Judicial Review to Judicial Supremacy",
      "content": "The scope of judicial authority in American constitutional law has never been definitively settled. In 1803, Chief Justice Marshall announced that \"[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\" This language supports a modest claim: when courts decide cases, they must interpret and apply the Constitution as law. But Marshall's dictum has been read to support a far more expansive proposition: that the Court's interpretation of the Constitution binds not only the parties before it, but all coordinate branches and even the American people as a whole.\n\nThe distinction between these two positions matters. Judicial review, modestly conceived, empowers courts to decline enforcement of statutes they deem unconstitutional in cases properly before them. This power follows from the Constitution's status as supreme law: when ordinary legislation conflicts with constitutional commands, courts must apply the higher law. Marshall himself framed the inquiry in these terms: \"It is a proposition too plain to be contested, that the constitution controls any legislative act repugnant to it.\" Judicial supremacy, by contrast, vests nine unelected Justices with final authority over contested constitutional meaning, treating the Court's pronouncements as equivalent to the constitutional text itself.\n\nA. The Departmentalist Tradition\n\nThis transformation was neither inevitable nor uncontested. Thomas Jefferson insisted that \"each of the three departments has equally the right to decide for itself what is its duty under the Constitution, without regard to what the others may have decided for themselves.\" On Jefferson's view, coordinate branches possess independent judgment; judicial interpretations bind only the case at hand, not constitutional meaning for all future controversies.\n\nAndrew Jackson, vetoing the Second Bank's recharter despite McCulloch v. Maryland's validation of the original Bank, declared bluntly that \"[t]he opinion of the judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the judges.\" Jackson denied that precedent constrained executive or legislative constitutional interpretation: \"[E]ach public officer who takes an oath to support the Constitution swears that he will support it as he understands it, and not as it is understood by others.\" For Jackson, McCulloch settled the dispute between the Bank and the state of Maryland; it did not settle the constitutional question for the nation.\n\nAbraham Lincoln, confronting Dred Scott v. Sandford, acknowledged the decision's binding effect on the parties but denied that it could \"irrevocably fix\" constitutional meaning for the nation: \"If the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court...the people will have ceased to be their own rulers.\" Lincoln distinguished judicial settlement of particular cases from judicial control over political questions. A decision might command obedience in the case decided, yet remain subject to challenge, legislative correction, or eventual overruling. This departmentalist position—that each branch interprets the Constitution within its sphere—competed with judicial supremacy well into the twentieth century.\n\nB. The Consolidation of Judicial Supremacy\n\nBut these departmentalist voices lost out, and by the early twentieth century, the Court functioned as the de facto final arbiter of constitutional disputes, though without explicit assertion of supremacy. The Lochner era (1897-1937) saw aggressive judicial invalidation of economic regulation, effectively entrenching the Court's constitutional vision over legislative judgments. Even after the \"switch in time\" of 1937 and the Court's retreat from economic due process, judicial authority over constitutional meaning remained largely unquestioned.\n\nThis transformation became explicit in Cooper v. Aaron (1958), where the Court, responding to Arkansas officials' resistance to desegregation, proclaimed that its interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment \"is the supreme law of the land.\" This language collapsed a critical distinction: Article VI makes the Constitution itself supreme, not judicial opinions about it. As Justice Frankfurter's concurrence candidly stated, the Court's reading \"can be changed only by constitutional amendment or by a later decision of this Court.\" By elevating the Court's interpretations to constitutional status, Cooper converted the judiciary from a participant in constitutional dialogue into its monopolist.\n\nC. The Political Genealogy of Judicial Supremacy\n\nThe political genealogy of judicial supremacy is worth touching on here as its origins come from noble intentions. When Congress proved paralyzed by Southern filibusters in the mid-twentieth century, civil rights advocates turned to federal courts as the only national institution willing to act. The Warren Court's decisions—Brown v. Board of Education (1954), Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), Miranda v. Arizona (1966)—came to symbolize the Court as an engine of progress when democratic institutions stalled. Liberals embraced what Lincoln had condemned: locating society-defining choices in an institution insulated from democratic accountability.\n\nThough that shortcut achieved important and necessary ends, it still came at a cost. Once ideological control shifted, conservatives deployed the same tool in reverse. The Burger and Rehnquist Courts slowed or overturned rights expansion. The Roberts Court accelerated the reversal—limiting the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), eliminating the constitutional right to abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), and restricting affirmative action in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (2023). The oscillation between judicial progressivism and judicial conservatism reveals the core instability: rights grounded solely in five votes remain perpetually vulnerable to the next five votes - or nine votes; the number of Justices in agreement does not change the underlying dysfunction.\n\nD. The Path Forward\n\nThe legitimacy crisis we now inhabit is not an accident but the predictable result of concentrating power to resolve open-textured constitutional questions in a body whose members serve for life, face no electoral accountability, and claim authority to bind the nation's understanding of liberty, equality, and due process. This Article proposes a structural correction: courts retain authority to adjudicate cases, apply existing precedent, and enforce constitutional minima entrenched in text and structure. But transformative changes to the level of constitutional protection—expanding or restricting recognized rights—require democratic authorization through recorded congressional votes subject to procedural safeguards. The Rule of Maintenance preserves judicial independence for ordinary adjudication while returning society-defining constitutional shifts to democratic institutions, bounded by non-derogable guarantees that no majority may override.",

      "title": "II. The Tenth Amendment's Truism and the Hollowing of Federalism",
      "content": "The Tenth Amendment states: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" On its face, this text announces a principle of enumerated federal powers with a residuum reserved to states and citizens. Yet doctrine has reduced this reservation to what the Court itself called \"but a truism\", a statement so obvious it adds nothing to constitutional analysis.\n\nA. The Anti-Federalist Demand for Textual Reservation\n\nThe Tenth Amendment emerged from Anti-Federalist demands for explicit textual protection of state sovereignty. The Federal Farmer warned that without such safeguards, consolidation would swallow state authority: \"It is as true that when the people by their Constitution delegate powers to the Congress, they also reserve some powers in themselves.\" Brutus predicted that absent robust reservation, the federal government would \"annihilate the state governments.\"\n\nFederalists responded that enumeration itself sufficed. Congress possesses only delegated powers, making a reservation clause redundant. Madison argued in Federalist Nos. 39, 45, and 46 that states retained residuary sovereignty by constitutional structure, rendering the Tenth declaratory rather than substantive. This Federalist minimalism would eventually prevail.\n\nB. From McCulloch to Darby: The Erosion of Textual Federalism\n\nChief Justice Marshall's opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) gave the Necessary and Proper Clause its broad construction, permitting Congress to adopt means \"convenient\" or \"conducive\" to executing enumerated powers. The Tenth played no limiting role; Marshall emphasized that federal powers emanate from the people, not from states, and thus cannot be curtailed by state-sovereignty arguments.\n\nThe decisive blow came in United States v. Darby (1941). Upholding the Fair Labor Standards Act's regulation of wages and hours, the Court declared: \"The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered.\" With this phrase, the Tenth was reduced from a potential check on federal power to a mere restatement of enumeration. If a power is delegated, the Tenth does not apply; if a power is not delegated, Congress lacks authority anyway. The Amendment adds nothing.\n\nLater decisions confirmed this retreat. In Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (1985), the Court abandoned judicial enforcement of federalism limits, holding that \"[s]tate sovereign interests...are more properly protected by the procedural safeguards inherent in the structure of the federal system than by judicially created limitations.\" The Tenth, in other words, was judicially unenforceable, and a matter for political process, not constitutional law.\n\nC. The Partial Revival: Anti-Commandeering and Spending Coercion\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the Court revived structural federalism limits, though not through the Tenth Amendment's text. In New York v. United States (1992), the Court invalidated a statute compelling states to legislate; in Printz v. United States (1997), it struck down federal conscription of state executive officers; and in Murphy v. NCAA (2018), it held that Congress cannot forbid states from repealing their own laws. Yet these holdings rest less on the Tenth Amendment itself than on structural principles implicit in the Constitution's federal design.\n\nSimilarly, in NFIB v. Sebelius (2012), the Court struck down the Affordable Care Act's mandatory Medicaid expansion as unconstitutionally coercive under the Spending Clause. Some hailed this as a Tenth Amendment revival, but the decision rests on spending-power limits, not the Tenth's text. Structural federalism survives in fragments, enforced unpredictably and categorically rather than as a continuous check on federal overreach.\n\nD. The Net Effect: Anemic Democratic Space\n\nThe overall effect is an anemic, sporadic federalism that too-rarely supplies a stable forum for democratic contestation or experimentation. The Tenth's promise—that undelegated powers remain with states and the people—has been hollowed out. What remains are episodic structural doctrines enforced inconsistently, leaving states with little autonomous constitutional space and citizens with no textual anchor for reserved authority. Combined with judicial supremacy, this erosion completes the double loss: the Court decides what the Constitution means, and little meaningful authority remains outside federal control.",
